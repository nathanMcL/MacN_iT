                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <p>That's it mister! you just lost your brain privileges! Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel. Squidward... I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet! Oh well, I guess I'm not wearing any pants today! Squidward, you're steaming. You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter. Well, it may be stupid, but it's also dumb. Don't genius live in lamps? Moss always points to civilization. See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old person thing. Now we say coral, as in that nose job is so coral. You can't fool me. I listen to public radio! If I were to die right now in a fiery explosion due to carelessness of a friend... then it would just be alright. Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain. Can't have dirty garbage! Y'all better apologize, or I'll be on you like ugly on an ape. Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch its stupid. Yeah, uhh... I'm with the pet hospital down the street, and I understand you have a dying animal on the premises... Stupid inflatable pants! We'd better do what he says... he knows how to grow food. Attention all employees! Just giving you a heads-up. I'll be conducting a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Whoever doesn't pass gets the boot. Spongebob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish, for twelve hours! But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck, and I'll need to remove your trousers. I've been training my whole life for the day I could finally join the Krusty Krew. Hey, look, a cardboard box washed up on the beach. Holy fish paste, it's a guy!!! It's okay, Spongebob! You can cheat! Cheat that way!</p>

I am the master at kara-tay. Who you callin' pinhead?! Patrick! Your genius is showing! More soup for your armpit? No Gary, I don't get colds, I get the suds. Put those eyeballs back in your head, son! We don't really have these powers! The powers are in the costumes. Why else would we wear underwear over our pants? I'm mad. I can't see my forehead. This city needs to be destroyed! Or at least painted another color. I wumbo, you wumbo, he she we wumbo. Wumboing, wumbology, the study of wumbo! It's first grade, Spongebob! You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night. Go ahead, guess! I'm cheating, Mrs. Puff! I'm cheating!</p> .Vivamus lacinia odio vitae vestibulum vestibulum.</p>

                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <p>You mean what we thought they thought we think and thought they thought? You're a man now, Spongebob, and it's time you started acting like one. We're in Squidward's body, no wonder it smells funny in here. Can you give Spongebob his brain back? I had to borrow it for the week. Did you hear about the goldfish that went bankrupt? Now he's a bronzefish. Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain. Insurance is what I need for a Krabby Patty. Spongebob doesn't have hair. Or does he? Try one of those radioactive sludge balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick! Can't have dirty garbage! Did I, Patrick? Did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it? We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request. No Gary, I don't get colds, I get the suds. There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true! Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch its stupid. Yeah, uhh... I'm with the pet hospital down the street, and I understand you have a dying animal on the premises... I have checks with little poodles on them. We'd better do what he says... he knows how to grow food. I have a theory: people talk loud when they wanna act smart, right? Either you (a) put the dime in me pants, (b) put the dime in me pants, or (c) put the dime in me pants! The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. Excuse me, sir? You're sitting on my face... which is also my body. Attention all employees! Just giving you a heads-up. I'll be conducting a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Whoever doesn't pass gets the boot. Spongebob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish, for twelve hours! The line for the Tunnel of Glove is filling up. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck, and I'll need to remove your trousers. Did you order twenty cases of... ripped pants?! That song was so righteous! Would you... sign my pants? How 'bout some soup on your best day ever?</p> .Vivamus lacinia odio vitae vestibulum vestibulum.</p>
